# What is `escapement`?
`escapement` is an R package developed by the USFWS Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Program for estimating salmon escapement from photo and video double-observer count data. It was specifically developed for Kodiak National Wildlife Refuges, but the functions following methods described in [Deacy et al. 2016](https://peerj.com/articles/2120).

# What's included?
The package includes functions to:  
1. Import a raw CSV file containing hourly counts of salmon quantified from photos and videos,
2. Evaluate a candidate list of competing models to estimate salmon escapement,
3. Generate tables and plots of the results, and
4. Produce a dynamic parameterized report (PDF) of the results.
